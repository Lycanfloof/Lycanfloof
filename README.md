## Hey there!

I'm Ariel Eduardo and I'm currently studying Software Engineering at ICESI University.

-There's not much to say, really. I'm just a furry who likes Math, Engineering and Drawing lol.

- I have an old GitHub account with old school stuff. If you ever want to take a look at that, check [this link](https://github.com/lyca22)!
