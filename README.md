## Hey there!

I'm Ariel Eduardo and I'm currently studying Software Engineering at Icesi University.

There's not much to say, really. I'm just a dude who likes furries, math and engineering lol.

I used to have an old GitHub account. If you ever want to take a look at that, check [this link](https://github.com/lyca22)!
